# ClassRoom-BookingSystem
A simple Classroom Booking system is a Mini Project assigned to my group towards the partial fulfilment for the subject -Object-oriented programming (DS2102). The code is written in the Python programming language, the Tkinter library is used for the GUI to make it interactive and MySQL is used for the database.<br/>
## Introduction
* This is a preliminary classroom booking system.<br/>
* Developed using Python library, Tkinter as front and MySQL for database management.<br/>
* User friendly, effective and saves user time in searching for a room.<br/>
* Alternative for the manual processing of booking for a room.<br/>
<br/>The main aim of our project “Room Booking System “is to make the process of booking any room at university an easy, time saving and hassle-free process. 
Earlier suppose if any faculty wanted to take a remedial class for a particular group of students, they had to first make sure that the existing schedule of the faculty itself and that of the group of students did not overlap. Moreover, there must be a vacant classroom in the university with a seating capacity as per the given strength of the specified group of students. But that’s still not sufficient. The faculty had to make sure that the room must also be available to them at a time when they wish to teach.
And even if all the above-mentioned conditions are met, but at the last moment the very same room is being used by another teacher.
What a waste of time and energy it is, isn’t it?<br/>
Hence, we present this computerized system. <br/>
## Features
* Log in/ Log out
* Add user details
* Book a room
* View details
* Cancel booking <br/>
<br/>Our Room Booking portal provides a platform for teachers as well as students, where one can check all the rooms that are available at a specified date and time with a seating capacity as per the requirement. 
The user must fill in some details on the login area and the portal displays the details that have already been fed on the database. It then shows the option to book a room, where on clicking the drop-down arrow one can see all the rooms available and the user may also cross check with the time slots in which a room of his/her choice is available. 
The user can login and check all the bookings that have been made from his /her login details.
In the unfortunate scenario where a scheduled class needs to be cancelled, the teacher or even the CR can use the portal to cancel the booking since the room is no longer required. By doing this, we can vacate the room for the faculty which requires it.
This system can be used not only to book rooms for lectures but also for a variety of purposes, such as for conducting classes, conferences, council meetings and even for conducting club activities like auditions.
